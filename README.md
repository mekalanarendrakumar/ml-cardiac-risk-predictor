# ml-cardiac-risk-predictor
"This project is an ML-based cardiac risk score predictor that analyzes patient health data and applies machine learning algorithms to estimate the risk of heart-related diseases, aiming to support early diagnosis and preventive healthcare."
1. Introduction
Heart disease is a leading cause of death worldwide. Early diagnosis plays a vital role in improving patient outcomes. This project focuses on developing and comparing different machine learning models to accurately predict the risk of getting a heart disease based on patient attributes.

2. Machine Learning Techniques
The project explores three different machine learning algorithms for classification:

Logistic Regression: A statistical model used for binary classification. It predicts the probability of an event occurring, in this case, the presence of heart disease.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A simple algorithm that classifies data points based on the majority class among their k-nearest neighbors. Distance metrics such as Euclidean and Manhattan distance are used to determine proximity.

Random Forest: An ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and robustness. It is less prone to overfitting compared to individual decision trees.
